# GraphQL Demo Project

## A Javascript Framework for Pinpointing Cats

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.

To get started:

From the `server` folder, start the GraphQL API server by typing:

```console
uname@os:~$ yarn install
uname@os:~$ yarn start
```

In another Terminal window, navigate to the `client` folder and type: 

```console
uname@os:~$ yarn install
uname@os:~$ yarn start
```

`localhost:3000` will present the demo application.
